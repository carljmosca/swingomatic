{"name":"Swingomatic","body":"Swingomatic is a program which provides a server interface to a Java Swing application.  It leverages an older \r\nrelease of Sun/Oracle's Java Accessibility utilities along with an embedded mini HTTP server.  XML is used to \r\npass data between the client and server.  The impetus for creating Swingomatic is the automation of a\r\nlegacy Java Swing application for which there are no immediate plans for replacement.\r\n\r\nThe intent was to create an interface which somewhat resembles a current web service-like approach to application\r\ninteroperability.  While leveragig an already exsiting Swing testing library would have been an attractive\r\nalternative, the restriction of running on an older version of Java (1.3) presented time-intensve challenges.\r\n![Swingomatic Architecture](server/src/main/resources/architecture.jpg)","tagline":"Java Swing application client","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
